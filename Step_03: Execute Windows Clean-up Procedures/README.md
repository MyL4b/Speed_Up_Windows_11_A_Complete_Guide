<h1 align="center">Deleting unused apps and optimizing Windows üßπüóëÔ∏è</h1>

Deleting unused apps from  Windows PC offers several important benefits. It helps free up valuable storage space and can improve overall performance by reducing background processes that consume memory and CPU. 
Additionally, fewer apps mean fewer automatic updates and notifications to manage, which can save time and bandwidth. On laptops, this can even lead to better battery life. Overall, uninstalling unused programs is a simple yet effective way to keep your computer running efficiently, securely, and smoothly.
