### Deleting unused apps and optimizing Windows 

Deleting unused apps from your Windows PC offers several important benefits. It helps free up valuable storage space and can improve overall performance by reducing background processes that consume memory and CPU. 
Additionally, fewer apps mean fewer automatic updates and notifications to manage, which can save time and bandwidth. On laptops, this can even lead to better battery life. Overall, uninstalling unused programs is a simple yet effective way to keep your computer running efficiently, securely, and smoothly.


### Deleting unused application:
1. Download the folder with essential cleanup software and unzip it.

2. Once unzipped, open the RevoUninstaller folder and run the application named RevoUPort.

3. In the top menu, select the Uninstaller option and delete all the applications you don’t use. I especially recommend removing OneDrive, Microsoft Edge browser, and WebView.

After completing this, go back to the top menu and select Windows Apps. From there, uninstall any unused apps. At the end of this guide, you’ll find a screenshot showing which apps I’m keeping for reference.
